## SEGUIApp

**SEGUIApp** is an app for gathering data from stock exchanges, saving it to files and present a live view to the user.

This project main purpose is to test different approaches to designing an app and improve my multithreading knowledge. In future releases, I'm going to implement a python module that will use gathered data to feed machine learning models.
